These folders contain the scripts for your HTA application. 

By including EVERYTHING your HTA needs to run (including the scripts here and portable interpreter binaries in the Binaries directory) 
into an EXE with VBAEdit you can write extensive applications using a wide variety of technologies.

So write some scripts in here to enable cool features and get your HTA to call those features using the Bootstrap() function in App-Core.vbs!

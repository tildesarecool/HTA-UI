These folders contain the portable distributions for additional scripting engines that you might want to use in your HTA.

By keeping portable binaries here you can use a tool like VBSEdit to create a standalone executable that supports multiple programming languages.

There are no binaries in these folders by default, as that would create a licensing & maintenancenightmare for me. You're free to use whatever you like!

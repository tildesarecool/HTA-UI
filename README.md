# HTA-UI
A **Ready-To-Customize** Windows Desktop Application template based on age-old Microsoft HTA technology with some new techniques to enable execution of **Python**, **PHP**, **Lua**, **Lisp**, or anything else you can get a portable interpreter for. If you follow the template guidelines you will be able to "compile" your HTA application (portable binaries and all) into a 32 or 64 bit stand-alone executable with [VBSEdit](https://www.vbsedit.com/).

# The Bootstrap() Function
HTA-UI comes with a simple yet powerful Bootstrap() function built into it's App-Core.vbs file. This function can be used to fire up an external program or interpreter (Like Python or PHP) to run built-in or external scripts. Substitute just about any interpreted language or portable binary and the Bootstrap() function will call it using whatever arguments you specify. 

# Create Graphical Desktop Applications Using Any Language And No Libraries
